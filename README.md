#Charter Enterprise Code Sample

##Build a message of the day webservice

Create a webservice that provides a "message of the day", similar to what you might see logging into a Unix system.  
This service will likely only have do two this; firstly to retrieve the message of the day, and second to change the 
message.  No message history or any other advanced functionality is needed, unless there is something you'd like to show
off.  The message can be stored in the service using any mechanism you like.  No need to implement a persistent store
like MySQL or Hypersonic.

### Project hints
1. We are a Spring Boot, and Docker shop.   Any use of that stack is ideal, but our goal isn't for you to spend a ton of
time on this.   Use what you're most familiar with.
1. Our main tools are Maven and Git.
1. Provide us with instructions on how to compile and run any of your code.  These instructions will require information
on installing any tools you choose that aren't Java or Maven.
1. Further hints are available.   Feel free to ask questions here.  Edit this file in your branch by adding to the
questions section, push it, and we will update the file with answers.
